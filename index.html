            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <div class="text">
                Hey, I'm Scott, a senior software developer based in Melbourne. Check out my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/scottbutler2005">LinkedIn</a>.

            <h1>Projects</h1>
            <div class="project mastermind">
                <h2>Mastermind</h2>
                <div>
                    Based on the Mastermind board game, I built this initially as a code kata exercise, using TDD as a guide. However, a console app isn't very exciting for what is quite a visual game!<br /><br />
                    I decided to give Blazor a try as it combines .NET and UI, two things I really enjoy. Once I'd built an initial proof of concept, I then discovered that Blazor WebAssembly projects can actually be hosted as a static site which allowed me to try out GitHub Actions to deploy it to GitHub Pages.<br /><br />
                    <strong>Tech:</strong> C#, Blazor WebAssembly, GitHub Actions, CSS and HTML with the Bootstrap grid system for the layout

            <div class="project domain">
                <h2>Domain Property Search</h2>
                <div>
                    This site uses the Domain property API to display properties matching the specified search criteria. I built this for two reasons:
                    <ol>
                        <li>To learn React - It's always helpful to have an actual problem to solve when learing new languages and frameworks</li>
                        <li>To add more search filters - I wanted to be able to search for properties that were within a certain distance of a train station</li>
                    </ol>
                    <strong>Tech:</strong> React, Bootstrap utility classes and the Bootstrap grid system for the layout<br /><br />
                    <strong>Note:</strong> This requires the use of API keys for the Domain API which are limited in their daily usage quota. As such I have not linked them here. <br />
                    Instead, the site will return demo data. If you have your own API key, you can supply it using the <pre>api_key</pre> query string parameter.

                <h2>PTV API Platform View</h2>
                <div>
                    This site uses the Public Transport Victoria (PTV) API to simulate what you might see on the passenger information screens at train stations in the Melbourne CBD.<br /><br />
                    <strong>Tech:</strong> Vanilla JavaScript, CSS, HTML and AJAX with the Bootstrap grid system for the layout<br /><br />
                    <strong>Note:</strong> This requires credentials for the PTV API which are subject to terms of use. As such I have not linked them here. <br />
                    Instead, the site will return demo data. If you have your own credentials, you can supply them using the <pre>d</pre> (developer id) and <pre>s</pre> (secret) query string parameters.
